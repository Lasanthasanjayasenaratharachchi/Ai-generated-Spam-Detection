## AI-Generated Spam Emails: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Existing Machine Learning Techniques for Detection


## Abstract

The increasing sophistication of AI-generated spam emails has made it more challenging for traditional spam detection techniques to identify and filter out these unwanted messages effectively. This study aims to evaluate the performance of various machine learning and deep learning techniques in identifying AI-generated spam emails.

The author utilised the Enron email dataset (2006) for model training and evaluation and applied preprocessing methods such as tokenisation and text cleaning. Additionally, sample spam emails were generated using the OpenAI API and Langchain with the power of the GPT-4 model. Six different models were implemented and compared, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression Model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and BERT.

The models' performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score metrics, graphical presentations, sensitivity analysis, and robustness with auto-generated spam emails and real-world mail. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current spam detection techniques against AI-generated spam emails and inform future research in developing more effective approaches to combating this challenge.

## Introduction

The proliferation of AI-generated spam emails presents a significant challenge to traditional spam detection methods. This README provides an overview of a study that evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning techniques in identifying AI-generated spam emails. The study utilizes the Enron email dataset (2006) for training and evaluation, as well as employs various preprocessing methods for data preparation. The README outlines the models used, the metrics employed to assess performance, and the significance of the study's findings.

## Dataset

The Enron email dataset (2006) serves as the foundation for this study's training and evaluation. It contains a diverse collection of emails, enabling the models to learn from real-world data. The dataset's characteristics and distribution are considered during preprocessing and analysis.

## Preprocessing

Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization and text cleaning. These steps are crucial in preparing the data for accurate model learning. Additionally, AI-generated spam emails are produced using the OpenAI API and Langchain with GPT-4, ensuring the inclusion of sophisticated spam content.

## Model Implementation

This study implements six distinct models to identify AI-generated spam emails. The models encompass both traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced deep learning architectures. The models considered are Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression Model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and BERT.

## Performance Evaluation

The effectiveness of the models is evaluated using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Graphical representations provide a visual understanding of the models' performance. The study also includes sensitivity analysis and robustness testing using auto-generated spam emails and real-world mail to simulate practical scenarios.

## Important instructions to run this project

The project runs in Python 3.11.4 environment, and dependencies are provided in the requirements.txt file in the repository.
The project consists of 3 main Ipython files and a Data directory.

- *****AI_mail_writer.ipynb*****  This file writes Emails using OpenAI API and Langchain and saves new emails in the "Data/Training_Data/Spam" folder. Once you run the file, the Popup window will ask you to input the required number of mails you want to generate so please key in the amount. Also, The program pushes Langchain summarised data into the OpenAI API GPT4 model, and this is a paid service. The API key is saved in "Data/APIKEY/key.txt" file. Please feel free to use it as much as you want for your marking process. in this process, the author used multiple Imaginary user profiles and course details to feed to the AI model to generate outputs. That information is saved in text files in the “Data/users” and “Data/Course_list” folders. All those names and details are Imaginary.

- *****Dataprocess.ipynb***** This file converts raw emails, saved in .txt format, into CSV files after completing the preprocessing and text cleaning process. Also, the file converts the Training dataset (Enron), and the testing AI dataset, which contain my inbox email and AI-generated emails, into two CSV file and save new files in the "Data/training_Data" folder.

- *****Email_classifier.ipynb*****  This is the main file, which takes all input data as a CSV file and performs the model training evaluation and outputs. The trained models and training history files are saved in the "Data/savedmodels" directory for easy prediction later with the new dataset.

## Conclusion

The study's findings shed light on the capabilities and limitations of current spam detection techniques when confronted with AI-generated spam emails. The insights gained from this research contribute to developing more effective approaches for combating this evolving challenge. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of various models, future research can focus on refining spam detection strategies in the face of advancing AI-generated spam tactics.
