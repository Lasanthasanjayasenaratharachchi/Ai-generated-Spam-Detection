Hi Olivia,

I came across your profile and noticed your dedication towards becoming a cybersecurity specialist. As a representative of XYZ-Edu, I wanted to introduce you to our "Practical API Hacking" course.

This course aligns with your interests, particularly with your expertise in Python and usage of security tools like Wireshark and Nessus. It provides an in-depth study of API vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques and hands-on experience using tools like Burp Suite and Postman. Enhancing your knowledge of API security could be a great value-addition to your cybersecurity skills.

As a student, we understand the constraints you may have and hence, I am excited to offer you a 20% discount on this course. This offer is limited to the first 100 students, so make sure to sign up soon! Find more details about the course here: https://academy.xyz-edu.com/p/hacking-apis
