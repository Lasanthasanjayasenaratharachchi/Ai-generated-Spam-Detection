Hi Jane,

Hope this email finds you well. I've noticed your incredible passion for cybersecurity and your involvement in ethical hacking and network security. This indicates your readiness to combat emerging threats in the digital world.

At XYZ-Edu, we've recently rolled out a course on "Practical Windows Forensics". It's perfect for someone with your interests and expertise. This comprehensive course deep dives into detailed digital forensic investigations on Windows systems. It uses freely available industry-standard tools for effective analysis and you'll gain an understanding of the forensic process and crucial Windows artifacts. 

As a special offer, we're providing a 20% discount for the first 100 students, and I believe this could be a valuable opportunity for you. You can explore more about the course here: https://academy.xyz-edu.com/p/practical-windows-forensics.
