Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. As a Cyber Security student with a firm interest in cybersecurity consulting, I believe our "Practical API Hacking" course at XYZ-Edu can significantly enhance your skill set.

This course is designed to help you uncover and exploit vulnerabilities in API-powered apps using tools like the Burp Suite â€“ one you're already familiar with. Moreover, it complements your interest in developing comprehensive security strategies for organisations.

In celebration of the course's launch, we are offering a 20% discount to the first 100 students. You can check out the details and enrol here: https://academy.xyz-edu.com/p/hacking-apis.

We believe this course will not only enhance your technical skills but also help build a strong foundation for your career aspirations in cybersecurity consulting.
