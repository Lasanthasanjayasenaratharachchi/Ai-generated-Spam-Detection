Hi John,

Hope you're well. I was impressed by your passion for cybersecurity and ongoing certifications as listed on your LinkedIn profile. As you continue to nurture your skills, I'd like to introduce you to our GRC Analyst Master Class at XYZ-Edu.

This course will broaden your understanding of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), critical areas often undervalued in cybersecurity. These competencies are indispensable for future professionals like you, who will be responsible for safeguarding digital assets and data. 

As you're always staying updated on cybersecurity trends and have shown interest in bug bounty programs, the live, hands-on labs in the course will be an invaluable addition to your learning journey. They will enable you to assess and calculate cybersecurity risks, navigate policies, procedures, and standards, and even create effective security awareness content to mitigate cyber risks. 

To make this opportunity even sweeter, we're offering a 20% discount to the first 100 students who register. You can enrol right here: https://academy.xyz-edu.com/p/grc. 

I truly believe this course will enrich your cybersecurity knowledge and help you reach your career objectives. If you wish to stop receiving these recommendations, you can unsubscribe at any time here: https://xyz-edu.com/newsletter/unsubscribe.

Thank you, John, and if there's any questions or if you need further information, feel free to get back to me.

Best regards,
Greg
