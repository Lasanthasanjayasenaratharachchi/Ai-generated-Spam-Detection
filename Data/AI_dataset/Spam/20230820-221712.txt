Hi Michael,

Hope you're doing well! I noticed your strong interest in cybersecurity consulting and enhancing security strategies for organisations. I believe our course, Practical Windows Forensic, could significantly benefit you.

This course provides extensive knowledge on conducting digital forensic investigations on Windows systems, including data collection, examination, extraction, and thorough analysis. It's a great addition to the security tools you are already familiar with, like Burp Suite and Splunk, and will enhance your skills in incident handling and risk assessment.

Furthermore, we're offering a 20% discount to the first 100 students who enrol. You can access the course through this link: https://academy.xyz-edu.com/p/practical-windows-forensics
