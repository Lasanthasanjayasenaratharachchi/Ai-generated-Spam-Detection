Hi Alex,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Greg, a sales rep with XYZ-Edu, and I've noticed your commitment to staying ahead of the cybersecurity landscape and your interest in ethical hacking.

Building on your existing skills, I think our Practical Windows Forensics course would be of great interest to you. It offers in-depth knowledge on forensic tools and artifacts, which could help you explore vulnerabilities and devise secure solutions more effectively. The course simulates real-world attack patterns, enhancing your incident response skills too. You can find more details here: https://academy.xyz-edu.com/p/practical-windows-forensics 

As an added perk, we're offering a 20% discount for the first 100 students. Considering your dedication and curiosity, I think this would be a brilliant opportunity for you to expand your capabilities and keep thriving in your cybersecurity journey.
