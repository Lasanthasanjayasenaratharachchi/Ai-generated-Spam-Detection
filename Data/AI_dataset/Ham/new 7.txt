A story from grief to giving
When Jackie‚Äôs son, Daniel tragically passed away in January 2021 it was an incredibly difficult time for the whole family. A friend from church introduced Jackie to the Olio app, initially suggesting it for sharing food, but Jackie could never have predicted what a pivotal role it would play in helping her with the grieving process.

"I later discovered the non-food section on the app and I just felt that maybe it was the right time to let go of some of Daniel‚Äôs treasured belongings."

The easy way to do your bit üåé
In July, the planet experienced its hottest week on record and with all the recent news of record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires and flash flooding across the world, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed by the climate crisis. But by taking small actions and working together, we have the power to make a huge difference.

Listen to our co-founder Tessa speak all about this on a recent episode of the High Performance podcast. And don't forget to give it a share; it's a fantastic way to tell others what Olio is all about and get them to join our planet-saving community.

Back to School is back‚Ä¶ 
Last year we launched our first Big Back to School Clearout with the target of sharing 30,000 kids' items in 30 days to help make going back to school more affordable for families and to give preloved stuff a second life. Thanks to all of you, we smashed this target with over 40,000 listings on the app!

If Olio has helped support your family, or a family close to your heart, through the back to school period, we‚Äôd love to hear how by filling in this two minute survey üôè
