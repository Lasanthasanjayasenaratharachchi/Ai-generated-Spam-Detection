 YouTube is introducing handles to make it easier for people to find and connect with each other.


Hi,


We're writing to let you know that over the coming weeks YouTube will be introducing handles to make it easier for members of the community to find and connect with each other. Your handle will be unique to your channel and will be how people mention you in comments, community posts, and more.


Here’s what you need to know:


We're gradually rolling out the ability to choose a handle for all channels over the coming weeks, and you will receive another email and a notification in YouTube Studio when you’re able to choose yours. In most cases, if you already have a personalized URL for your channel, we’ve reserved this for you as your handle. If you want a different handle from the one we’ve reserved, you can change it. If you don’t already have a personalized URL today, you’ll also be able to choose a handle for your channel.


Starting on November 14, 2022, if you haven’t yet selected a handle for your channel, YouTube will automatically assign you a handle, which you can change in YouTube Studio if you'd like.


In the meantime, learn more about handles and all the things you’ll be able to do with them:

Sincerely,
The YouTube team




You received this mandatory email service announcement to update you about important changes to your YouTube channel or account.
