Have you ever lost money from your deposit?
We know it can be an anxious time waiting for your deposit to be returned and it makes sense, often you’re waiting on a lot of money and the process feels out of your control.



Recently we sent you an email giving you the lowdown on deposits. Check it out here if you missed it.



This time, we want to go one step further and find out whether you’ve ever had any of your deposit deducted in the past and if so, what these deductions were for.



We want to help renters avoid this as much as possible in the future so once we know the most common reasons we’ll follow up with tips and advice.
