Hello again!

Before we review your application, we need you to take a short online assessment. It only takes a few minutes to complete.

If you have already taken our assessment many thanks for doing so. You don't need to take it again.
If you haven't taken our assessment please click on this link to get started Situational Judgement Test - Retail Assistant.
If you don't finish within 7 days, we'll have to turn down your application, so please get started as soon as you can.

Please ensure you use a desktop device when accessing your assessment.

Good luck.
