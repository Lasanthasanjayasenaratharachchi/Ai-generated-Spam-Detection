Hi,

We can see you've started an application for our Services Assistant role - great! Remember to complete and submit your application before the closing date if you still want to be considered for the role.

If you don't submit your completed form, we'll store the data you entered for 30 days. But if you want to apply after the 30 days, you'll have to start the process from scratch.

Oh, and if you decide you don't want to apply for the job anymore, you can always delete the data you entered.

We're looking forward to hearing from you.

All the best,

Sainsbury's Recruitment Team
