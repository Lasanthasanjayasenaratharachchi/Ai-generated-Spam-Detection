Back in May we explored where to find graduate opportunities, how to approach speculative applications and the skills you'll need as a graduate in the job market.

For many of you, this transition into graduate life will be fast approaching and whilst we know this change can be exciting, you might also be feeling apprehensive or anxious about what to do next. But you don't have to do it alone as your Careers and Enterprise Team are on hand to help you transition into graduate life and beyond.

This will be your final edition of the newsletter and we'll be focussing on the support available to you once you leave the university as well as some top tips on how to make the transition easier.

Spotlight on...the graduate Career Toolkit
We've mentioned the Career Toolkit a lot over the past few months so hopefully you've had a chance to explore it's brilliant career tools, articles and resources.

The good news is this won't stop once you graduate as you'll get lifetime access to the toolkit even after you've left. All you need to do is update your details in myUWE before you graduate to change your registered account.

This is important for more than just toolkit access so why not familiarise yourself with our final year checklist and the information on our IT guidance for graduating students webpage.
Careers support for graduates 
In addition to lifetime access to the toolkit you'll also get three years of 1-2-1 career coaching and enterprise appointments (five years for UWE Cares graduates).

Our brilliant coaches can help support you with everything from CVs and interviews to starting your own business.

But don't wait until you graduate to get help - the team are on hand over summer to support you with your career steps.
