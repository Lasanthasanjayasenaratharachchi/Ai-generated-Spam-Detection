There's still time to complete the Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey
Time is running out to complete the Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey. Please complete it now. This is your chance to tell us about the experience you've had on your course.

The feedback you give in this survey can really help your programme team to identify what they are doing well and where they need to make improvements.

The survey will take about 15 minutes to complete and you have the chance to win one of ten £100 Amazon or Love2shop gift vouchers.

Your responses are confidential and any reporting will be anonymous.

If you have any difficulties logging into the survey, please email the Student Partnership Team.

Thank you for your time.
