Step into the world of comprehensive digital forensic investigation with our course designed to provide a complete DYI setup for Windows systems.

The objective of this course is to guide students through the intricacies of performing an extensive digital forensic investigation on a Windows system. The journey commences with the preparation of our lab environment, establishing both a "victim" VM and a dedicated forensic workstation. With this foundation in place, we'll simulate attack patterns on the victim VM, mirroring real-world scenarios faced by threat actors. This simulation sets the stage for our investigation, where data collection, examination, extraction, and meticulous analysis take center stage.

Our data analysis segment delves deep into the heart of investigation. Covering a multitude of tools and diverse forensic artifacts, we arm every analyst with the familiarity essential for proficient analysis. Beyond artifact analysis, we explore the behaviors behind these digital traces, gaining insights into interpreting the data within. The investigation encompasses artifacts from Windows disks and memory, culminating in the examination of timelines generated from both sources.

Encompassing critical artifacts and concepts in Windows forensic analysis, this course seamlessly integrates several well-known, industry-recognized tools for analysis. These tools, freely available, equip you for efficient analysis. By the end of the course, you'll possess a comprehensive grasp of the forensic process, crucial Windows artifacts, forensic tools, and a ready-to-deploy forensic workstation, poised for future investigations.
